# Description
This project reproduces key findings from Gasch et al. (2017) by analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae under stressed and unstressed conditions. Using SMART-seq-based expression profiles, we explore regulatory heterogeneity by examining gene modules such as ribosomal protein (RP) and induced Environmental Stress Response (iESR) genes. The analysis includes log-transformed normalization, mean-centering, module scoring and visualization of cell-to-cell variation in stress-responsive gene expression.
